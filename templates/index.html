        <hr>
        <p class="text_"> How cancer begins?<br>
          Cells are the basic units that make up the human body. Cells grow and divide to make new cells as the body
          needs them. Usually, cells die when they get too old or damaged. Then, new cells take their place.
          Cancer begins when genetic changes interfere with this orderly process. Cells start to grow uncontrollably.
          These cells may form a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is
          malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow
          but will not spread.
          Some types of cancer do not form a tumor. These include leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.
          Doctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are:<br>
          <br><strong>1. Carcinomas.</strong> A carcinoma begins in the skin or the tissue that covers the surface of
          internal organs and glands. Carcinomas usually form solid tumors. They are the most common type of cancer.
          Examples of carcinomas include prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>2. Sarcomas.</strong> A sarcoma begins in the tissues that support and connect the body. A sarcoma can
          develop in fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, blood vessels, lymph vessels, cartilage, or bone. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>3. Leukemias.</strong> Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Leukemia begins when healthy blood cells
          change and grow uncontrollably. The 4 main types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic
          lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>4. Lymphomas.</strong> Lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system
          is a network of vessels and glands that help fight infection. There are 2 main types of lymphomas: Hodgkin
          lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        <hr>
        <p class="text_"> From Wisconsin Cancer Database, we analyze 569 individuals and check their correlation and
          how accuary the logistic regression model can predict the diagnosis of a cancer patient</p>
        <p class="text_"> Derived from UCI Machine Learning Repository, Wisconsin cancer dataset is available in
          python's sklearn library.</p>
        <p class="text_">
          <strong>Attribute Information:</strong>
          <br>
          1) ID number <br>
          2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: </strong><br>

          a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) <br>
          b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) <br>
          c) perimeter <br>
          d) area <br>
          e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) <br>
          f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) <br>
          g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) <br>
          h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) <br>
          i) symmetry <br>
          j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Wisconsin dataset is also available through the UW CS ftp server:</strong>
          <br>
          --> ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu
          <br>
          --> cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Also can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository:</strong>
          <br> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Class distribution:</strong> 357 benign and 212 Malignant <br>
          This data shows that 62.74% of the cells were bening.<br>
          This data shows that 37.26% of the cells were malignant.
